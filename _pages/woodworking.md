In this section I am writing about my woodworking projects. They usually start with an idea that I or my wife got.

Sometimes it is plainly the answer to the question "is it worth it to spend *a lot* of money on something that shouldn't be to hard to make myself?" - like cabinets or shelves for the garage or the workshop, or a raised plant bed.

Then there are things like tools, jigs or storage, that are needed in the process of building something else.

And sometimes I just want to have fun or do something else, getting away from the IT, etc... :wink:
