Hi,

My name is Mario a.k.a. McFiscH. I'm a SysAdmin, a DevOps Engineer, a Geek, a Casual Gamer, a Casual Musician, a Woodworker - oh, and a Dad and Husband as well, so there might be a pun or a dad joke appear here or there in this blog. And since I'm German, they may even be more terrible than one would expect... [*continue*](/about/)
