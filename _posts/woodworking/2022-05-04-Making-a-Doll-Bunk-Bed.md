A couple weeks before her fifth birthday my little girl told me that her favorite dolls Anna and Elsa - two Barbie-sized Dolls of the famous "Frozen" characters - would have nowhere to sleep. She then asked if I could build a bunk bed for them, and obviously I couldn't deny her that wish. So I sketched a plan out in SketchUp, got a thin board of oak from my scraps pile, two bamboo skewers from the kitchen, and then started working.

# Modelling

I used SketchUp to plan out a model of what I had in mind. The idea was to take a board I had left from another project, cut it into some strips, and then glue them together to resemble a bed. 

But I'm usually overthinking this kinda stuff, and this project wasn't different. I knew I just got some boards of oak flooring cut-offs that I could mill to the right size, but I kind of wanted to use up one I had that already was milled to the right thickness. So with that in mind I designed a bunk bed with the measurements of roughly 12" x 6" x 9".

While modeling the details and checking the material requirements I've noticed that my model was much wider than needed, so I changed the width to about 4.5 inches. I also increased the length by half an inch to account for the thickness of the stiles that were about to make up the posts of the bed.

Though I've planned on using half-laps for all joints I felt like I would need to add some extra strength to the build, so it would have a better chance of surviving when my daughter was going to play with it. That's where the bamboo skewers came into play. They were going to become loose tenons that were about to reinforce the entire structure.

When I felt like my model was done I've made a part list. That I fed into a cut list generator [link] that allowed me to not only verify that I actually had enough material, but also gave me a visualization of which cuts to make to get the most out of the board.

# Materials and tools

## Woods

### Square stock: oak board

This piece of oak I had left from one of my earliest builds: a smartwatch charging stand where I used strips of this big box store purchase as kind of miter keys to strengthen some joints. It was roughly of the size 20" x 3" x 1/4", and I never really found another use for this thin board. But now finally was the time to use it up.

### Round stock: bamboo skewers

For the ladder steps as well as the dowels/tenons I wanted some round stock, so I went to the kitchen and grabbed two bamboo skewers.

### Sheet goods: plywood

For the boards that would make the those parts of the bed that hold the mattresses I've cut up a scrap piece of a really soft 1/4" ply. In hindsight it would have been better to use either MDF or hardboard because of their much smoother surface, but when I realized that it was already too late and the plywood glued in.

## Fabrics and filling
For the bedding I've used some packaging material: pieces of a rigid plastic foam as mattresses, and some thin, soft foam that came from a TV protective packaging as filling for the blankets and pillows. The fabric for all these was sewn by my wife, using up some leftover fabric from when she made masks for the kids during the pandemic.

## Tools

There was nothing really special to the tool set, although it surely goes a little beyond what most DIY people have in their garage or tool shed. If these tools wouldn't have been available, a set of hand saws (like japanese pull saws) would have worked out, too - but the effort and required skill level would have been much higher. 

### Table saw

To cut the oak board into strips, the table saw was pretty handy, and better suited, for instance, than a band saw. I've used two kind of special blades this time.

#### Thin kerf 7-1/4" circ saw blade

Though my table saw is made for 10" blades I've specifically chosen to use a smaller blade to cut up the oak board. This helped keeping the waste down. The kerf (the width of the actual cut) is only slightly larger than half the a full kerf of my regular 10" combination blade, and still smaller than a 10" thin kerf rip blade. I got this blade in a clearance sale at a big box store specifically for ripping smaller pieces of wood.

#### Box joint blade 

This is a form of a dado blade made by Freud, just that lacks the shims and chipper blades that are typical for a dado stack. This specific blade set consists of 2 blades with wide offset teeth, that - depending of the way they are positioned to each other - have a kerf width of either 1/4" or 3/8". Though this blade set is specifically meant for cutting box joints it works for dados of these two widths as well. Another benefit for my personal setup is that this is the max size of dado cuts that my table saw can do - and that without even having to get a dado insert for the saw.

However, I've used this blade set to cut the half laps into the oak strips.

### Drill press

Though it certainly would have been possible to drill the holes for the bamboo skewers by hand I have used my drill press for that as it is a much more stable way to drill consistently perpendicular holes into the oak strips, especially after the glue-up.

### Flush cut saw, chisel

for cleaning up the ends of the skewers after gluing them in I used a flush cut saw as well as chisel. The latter also came to use for the mortises where the stretchers under the boards were added for stability.

# The build process

## Cutting

The first step was to rip down the oak board into strips that were 1/4" wide, following the cut list I created earlier. Then the strips were cut to length. After switching to the box joint blades I've cut the rabbets and dados into these strips where they were going to be joined later with half laps.

I've also cut the plywood strip into 2 pieces of the same size to make up the mattress boards.

## Fitting

Some of the rabbets and dados needed a bit of cleanup, so I took a chisel, some sand paper and a file and made them work as good as I could. Some still look a bit sloppy, but for my first time doing that kind of detail work I think it is good enough.

## Glueing

When all parts seemed to fit together well enough I started glueing them together. I used very little clamping pressure, mostly with bandy clamps, just enough to ensure a proper hold at the joints. It went so well that I totally forgot to put the plywood pieces in place. When I noticed that it was already too late - they wouldn't go in. At that moment I just left them out, postponing the search for an alternative way to make them work.

## Tenoning

To strengthen the joints I had decided to use small dowels. Well, compared tho the size of the oak strips they actually weren't that small. They were going to be legit lose tenons, half the size of the joined pieces. So I drilled 1/8" holes into each joint, making sure the dowel would get proper contact with all mating pieces. 

When all holes were drilled I cut the skewers into small sections of about 1/2" each. Then I glued them into the holes I drilled. When the glue was almost dry I cut off the parts of the dowels that were sticking out, then cleaned them up with a chisel. In this process I've also removed the remaining glue squeeze-out.

## Forcing the ply in

Well, before even seriously thinking about an alternative solution I just forced the boards in, going diagonally through the front, partially out the back, then back in, into the final position, pushing the frame as much as it needed to. I figured this would also make for a good test of stability - and it worked: the boards were in, and the whole construction has proven strong enough even for this kind of abuse.

A little bit of glue and the weight of some heavier wooden blocks were enough to secure the boards in place.

## Cleanup

After the construction was done, I took some sand paper and cleaned up the surfaces. I didn't go too crazy, just knocking off the saw marks and smoothing the edges, just so everything felt nice to the touch. I also had to sand down one of the foots of the bed a little bit because it was rocking a little.

## Finish

To finish the doll bed I used a butcher block conditioner, based on mineral oil, beeswax, and carnauba wax. I rubbed in 2 coats, wiped off the excess and polished it a little. The important thing here was that the conditioner is safe for food contact, even exceeding the FDA regulations. So it would be safe for kids, too, even if they would decide to chew on the wood.

# Bedding

The last task remaining was to make some bedding. My wife used her sewing skills to sew some foam packing material into the fabrics she's chosen, creating mattresses, pillows and blankets for the dolls.

# The present

When we presented our daughter the now finished toy she really loved it. Seeing this kind of happiness in your child is one of the greatest things in live.

This was a really fun build, totally worth the effort and a great way to use up some scrap and household material. I'm looking forward to building more furniture, next time in full size. I've already made some plans for the next projects, so stay tuned...
