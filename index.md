# Welcome at McFiscH's _(yay, another blog!)_

Hi,

My name is Mario a.k.a. McFiscH, and I'm a SysAdmin, a Geek, a Casual Gamer, a Casual Musician, a Woodworker - oh, and a Dad, so there might be one or two puns and dad jokes appear in the blog. And since I'm German, they may even be more terrible than you'd expect...

I live in the San Francisco East Bay in California.

Mostly I want to write about very specific issues I have to solve with all the gadgets and tech at home (as those are usually the issues I _can_ solve - unlike those with the kids, for example). Many of these (the tech issues, not the kids) will be something that arise from special circumstances that make it harder to find solutions online, so I hope mine will help others, too. Others may grow off situations where I've gone wrong at some point, but was too stubborn or just incapable of acknowledging my own failure, doing what Germans excel in: "keep riding the dead horse".

Some of the post will be about woodworking projects, may or may not have finished, as this is another thing I like to do but don't have as much time for as I'd would like to.

However, I hope you enjoy what you see here, come back any time!

_-- Mario_
